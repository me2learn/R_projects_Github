This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.


```{r}
getwd()
list.files()
cbf <- read.csv("df.csv")
```
```{r}
# libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(skimr)
library(knitr)
```

```{r}
cbf %>% head() %>% kable()
```

```{r}
cbf %>% skim()
```

```{r}
start(cbf)
```
 This is a case for Univariate Time Series Analysis
